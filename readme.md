7. Graphics Design

## Human Input-Output Channel
Human output -> computer input
computer output -> human input

### Human Inputs (how we can make human helping things wrt their)
1. Sight:  auto brightness
   - Visual Angle : substance at distance
   - Visual Acuity : ability to preceive fine details of the object
3. Hearning: sound limit, threshold limit for loud sound
4. Touch : phone with mat finish, glass ginish

### Human Output/Effectors
1. Limbs
2. fingers: majority of work in comp done with computers
3. Head and body position
4. Voice

# Human Memory
## Sensory memory -> short term memory -> Long term memory
storing and retival of information 
1. **Sensory Memory**:  memory through sences, senses produces stumili, this stumili is takes by senses mamory namely
   - Iconic Memorey:  of eyes
   - Echoic memory: of ears
   - Haptic Memory - of touch


2. **Short term memory**: attention given to sensory memory converts to short term memory, storage: 3-4 chunks
   
3. **Long Term Memory**: Main storage (individuality)
      - Epsodic : rembering the events in sequence
      - Semantic : Skills/facts knowledge

      - **Information Store**: Repeated exposure of stumili
      - **Loss of Info:** we forget the things
      - **Retrival of info:**recalling the information
        
# Thinking, Reasoning and Problem Solving
There are different types of thinking (extreme thinkers and less thinkers), and different thinking styles between these extremes, (developers need to keep in mind all types of thinkers during developing), inportant ingredient of thinking is knowledge
## Reasoning
   councluding wrt to your existing knowlegde is reasoning
  - ### Deductive Reasoning
  - It not good quality of reasoning example:- 
    - if it is sunday he will watch movie
    - it is sunday
    - therefore he will watch movie
  - Example 2:
    - if it is raining then ground is dry
    - it is raining
    - therefore ground is dry
      
  - ### Inductive reasoning
  - Generalising from cases we have seen to infer information about the cases we have not seen
     - POSITIVE EVIDENCE: eveidence in support
     - NEGATIVE EVIDENCE: evidenve which disprove, what we know
       
 - ###  Abductive Reasoning
 - deriving some information about the event that is happening infront of us
 - ACTION -> EVENT (we can consider action will lead to event)
## Problem Solving
  - Resue of knowledge
  - Insight
  - trial and error
